Here we explore environmental and anthropogenic covariates driving the spatial variation in SMDWs, and generate a global map of subnational (GADM version 3.6) estimates of SMDWs use across 135 low- and middle-income countries. Further, we determine the dominant factors limiting use of SMDWs around the world.
